# Optimization-based Motion Blur aware Camera Pose Estimation

This GitLab repository contains the Python code for the optimization-based
motion blur aware camera pose tracker.

## Context

A large percentage of mobile robotics applications adopt vision-based estimation of their positions within the environment in order to perform automated or semi-automated tasks. Commonly used methods, such as visual odometry (VO) or simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), require the input images to be sharp. In practice, these kinds of methods tend to fail or provide inaccurate results in the present of motion blurring due to rapid movements in combination with a long exposure time.


### Installation

This installation was tested for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. For other operating sys-
tems, changes or additional packages might be required. The following
