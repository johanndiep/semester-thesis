Hyperparameters chosen so far
------------

* Number of poses to generate synthetical image: N_poses (must be defined, tested between 3-20)
* times at pose P_t: t_t (timestamp at closing shutter)
* Exposure time: t_exp
* Pose at the end: P_t <-> Initialization P_tilde -> Initialization offset 
* Pixel in the resulting blurred image are set to be non-empty only if 1/5 of the reprojected poses has information
* Penalizing empty pixels: a =5
* Cost function: C(P_t)
* Distance between two consecutive images: 26.7cm (std: 2.7cm)
* Distance traveled during open-shutter time: 10.6cm (std: 1.1cm)
* Gradient of intensity: nabla_I (Sobel filter)
* Scaling factor: sigma_0 (tuning such that pertubuation is not higher than 2, 0.02-0.30)
* Decay factor: alpha (set to 1x10^-10)




Implementation
------------

* Coarse-to-fine image resolution: Implementation of the coarse-to-fine method to run the minimalization step more efficiently.
